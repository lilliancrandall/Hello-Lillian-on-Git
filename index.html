<p class= "paragraph">      Each day, I receive a notification with a headline news story from the New York Times. 
  For my 5 in 5 project I took a screenshot of the first alert I received each day and 
  created an illustration through a Mandala technique using the Apple Pencil and iPad Pro.

  <ul style="font-family: futura" class="lister">
    <strong>Constraint-</strong> Using the radial symmetry style of the Mandala Technique create an illustration
    <br>
    <strong>Conditional-</strong> Using the New York Times headliner, create a mandala illustration<br>
    to convey the headline.

    On Thursday, the New York Times headlined an article about
    how counties that voted for Trump are doing in his economy which inspired my drawing to be an
    abstract expressionistic interpretation of the healdine. At first, I did this Mandala artwork
    with color, using lot of greens to symbolize money, in relation to economy. I felt this made the final 
    series seem inconsistent.

      On Friday, the New York Times headliner an article about
      Paul Taylor who has deceased at 88. He was known for his beauitiful choreography
      and so I was inspired to draw a flowing, arbitrary mandala to convey
      the fluidity of dancing.

      On Saturday, the New York Times headlined an article discussing Beto
      O'Rourke intentions to beat Ted Cruz in the race for Senate in Texas.
      Words that led me to draw a sugar skull/alien themed mandala included 
      unapologetically, Democrat, win, trump country. These made me think of
      a dead waste land type of art to represent this headline. Again, with this 
      mandala illustration, I chose to create an arbitrary interpretation rather
      a literal expression.
